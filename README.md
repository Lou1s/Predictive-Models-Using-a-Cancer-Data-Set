# Predictive Models Using a Cancer Data Set
## Introduction
This project is utilising a dataset of breast cancer patients in order to develop predictive models. Specifically, we aim to create models that are able to predict the end result for a given cancer patient's diagnoses (essentially, fatal or non-fatal). Each model will use various features to determine the likelihood of fatality, such as duration of symptoms, which hospital the patient visited, what stage of cancer they have etc.

## Code
At the current point only data cleaning has been completed. This was all done in the cleaning notebook. Next up a models notebook will be created. This notebook will utilise various unsupervised machine learning algorithms to determine if we can accurately predict the fatality likelihood of a given diagnoses.

## Publication
Following the development of these predictive models the results will (hopefully) be documented in an academic paper and published in a journal or conference.
